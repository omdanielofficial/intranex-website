### 1. Introduction

[1.1] We are very confident in the reliability of the service we provide. We understand how crucial it is for an online service to maintain high availability, which is why we provide a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to cover our clients in the event of a service disruption. Applicable services include all shared, cloud, or dedicated hosting-based products. 

### 2. SLA Coverage

[2.1] Network - We guarantee 99.99% network availability in a calendar month to all applicable services. If at any time our service does not maintain this agreement for at least 30 consecutive minutes (the grace period), the affected service will be covered by our SLA.

[2.2] Hardware - We guarantee our physical machines will be able to supply service at all times for all applicable services. If at any time our machines are not able to maintain this agreement for at least 30 consecutive minutes (the grace period), the affected service will be covered by our SLA.

[2.3] Denial of Service Attack (DoS/DDoS) - We guarantee protection against all types of Denial of Service attacks. If we are unable to mitigate a denial of service attack within 90 minutes (the grace period), the affected service will be covered by our SLA.

### 3. SLA Limitations

[3.1] Planned Maintenance - Occasionally we need to perform maintenance on our services that may result in temporary downtime. We aim to announce all planned maintenance in advance via email and other official communication channels, however advance notice is not always possible.

[3.2] Software Error/Failures - Software is not within the scope of our service. Therefore we do not cover errors, crashes or any service interruptions caused by software.

[3.3] Interruptions caused by the client - We do not cover issues caused by the client such as installing third-party files and software or custom scripts.

[3.4] Exceeding allocated resources - Interruptions due to the affected service using more resources than available are not covered.

[3.5] Circumstances beyond our control - Force majeure or any act of God which results in failure of service.

### 4. Non-Compliance Claims

[4.1] In the event of non-compliance, the client will be compensated.

[4.2] For every 30 minutes of downtime after the initial grace period has expired, we will provide account credit worth 1% of the total monthly bill for the affected service. 

[4.3] Services on quarterly or annual billing cycles are awarded credit based on their individual monthly value, not the overall value.

[4.4] To receive service compensation, the client must create an SLA claim by opening a support ticket from their client account

[4.5] SLA claims must be submitted within 48 hours of the outage beginning. The client is responsible for creating a claim in order to receive compensation. Compensation is awarded only as account credit, which can be used to purchase or renew services, and is not redeemable as any form of currency.

[4.6] All SLA claims will be investigated. The outcome of such claims will be decided at our sole discretion. Any SLA claims we deem to be fraudulent or invalid will be rejected.

[4.7] We reserve the right to deny SLA claims if we believe the client has purposely attempted to cause a service disruption to claim against our SLA (e.g. if we believe the client was involved in initiating a denial of service attack against their own service).

[4.8] This SLA is only valid for direct clients. We are not liable for downtime caused by any reseller of our services.

### 5. Amendments

[5.1] We reserve the right to amend or vary the terms of our SLA at any time. Any changes will be reflected immediately on this document.
