### 1. Shared Hosting Resources

#### 1.1 CPU and RAM
Accounts on shared hosting plans may not excessively consume CPU or RAM resources for prolonged periods. Scripts that consume more than 25% of system resources for longer than 90 seconds may be terminated.

#### 1.2 Storage
Storage space is for website files only. Using shared hosting space for backups of other devices, heavy file sharing, or storage of copyrighted material not owned by you is prohibited.

### 2. Bandwidth Usage

While many plans offer "Unlimited" bandwidth, this is subject to fair use. If your usage significantly impacts network performance for other users, we may ask you to upgrade to a VPS or Dedicated Server.

### 3. VPS and Dedicated Servers

#### 3.1 Network Fairness
For servers with unmetered bandwidth, fair use applies. Consistent maximal utilization of the uplink (e.g., running at 100% capacity 24/7) is prohibited unless explicitly agreed upon in a custom contract.

#### 3.2 CPU Abuse
Mining cryptocurrency on VPS instances is strictly prohibited as it degrades performance for neighbors on the host node. Mining on Dedicated Servers is permitted.
